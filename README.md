# RemindTalkingWithFriends-
simple C++ program to ask friends how things going!


The program will take out the date of the curren day and use if statement to remind you to talk to friends at the end of the month!

After taking the date using C++ function we store it into a variable and use if statement

// If the date is less than 16: Remind yourself to focus on working and be happy
// If the date is greater than 16: Remind yourself to be happy and remember to talk to your friends when time comes!
// if the date is 28, 29, 30, or 31. Remind yourself to spend time with friends and be happy!
